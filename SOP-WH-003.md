# SOP-WH-003 – Inventory Management
**Version:** 1.0  
**Effective Date:** TBD  
**Last Review Date:** TBD  
**Approved By:** TBD  

## Purpose
To ensure accurate inventory records, proper handling of damaged, short, or excess stock, and effective warehouse housekeeping.

## Scope
Applies to all stock stored in Purple Octopus Ventures LLP’s Dive Gear Equipment Distribution warehouse, covering detection, investigation, adjustment, and documentation of discrepancies.

## Policy Statement
- Damaged stock → move to Quarantine bin (physical and system movement).  
- Excess stock → investigate against WIR tracker; if no cause found, adjust inventory (write-in).  
- Short stock → investigate against WIR tracker; if no cause found, adjust inventory (write-off).  
- All write-ins and write-offs must be recorded in their respective trackers.  
- Quarantine stock may only be released or scrapped with approval.  
- Discrepancy detection occurs via **Scheduled Cycle Counting**, **Reactive Cycle Counting**, or **Annual Stock Take**.  
- All bins under any type of count must be **blocked** in the WMS to prevent allocation until counts are completed and reconciled.  
- Periodic cleaning of bin locations is required for stock integrity.

## Detection Methods
1. **Scheduled Cycle Counting** – sweep through all bins every 6 months; weekly reporting of progress/results.  
2. **Reactive Cycle Counting** – triggered by customer discrepancy; trace order to bin, investigate.  
3. **Annual Stock Take** – full warehouse count once a year.

## Responsibilities
- **Warehouse Staff:**  
  - Perform counts and investigations as per WIs.  
  - Update trackers for write-ins/write-offs.  
  - Ensure bin blocking during counts.  
- **Warehouse Manager:**  
  - Approve adjustments and final investigation reports.  
  - Sign off on annual stock take results.
